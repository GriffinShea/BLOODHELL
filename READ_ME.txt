Description:	This project was submitted as an assignment for COMP1501 - Introduction to
		Computer Game Design, in February 2018. I was tasked with taking an existing
		piece of Python code and turning it into a full game. The given code contained a
		simple algorithm for a rotating line that can detect collisions with circles.
		I adapted this code into a dark fantasy themed game where you play as a knight
		equipped with only a sword trying to escape from a hellish dungeon. Uses Python 3
		and the pygame library.
