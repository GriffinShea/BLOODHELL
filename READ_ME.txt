Description:	This project was submitted as an assignment for COMP1501 - Introduction to
		Computer Game Design, in February 2018. I was tasked with taking an existing
		piece of Python code and turning it into a full game. The given code contained a
		simple algorithm for a rotating line that can detect collisions with circles.
		I adapted this code into a dark fantasy themed game where you play as a knight
		equipped with only a sword trying to escape from a hellish dungeon. Uses Python 3
		and the pygame library. I was not a very experienced programmer at the time that
		I created BLOODHELL, so there are a few inefficiencies/errors in the code and game
		logic (for example, player will get stuck to walls). Overall however, I think I
		did a pretty good job.
		
Instructions:
		1. Download the folder labeled executable, keep the assets folder with the
		   BLOODHELL.exe file.
		2. Run BLOODHELL.exe.
		3. Follow instructions in game to play the game. The objective is to reach the gate
		   in the north end of the map.
